# Repository Map

Modules, source files, build files, dependencies and generated output. Keep it current with structure
changes (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Top level

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `plan.md` | Development plan (phases, design decisions). |
| `.agents/01-plan.md`, `.agents/00-finished.md` | Open tasks and the log of finished ones. |
| `.codex/arch.md`, `.codex/map.md` | Architecture notes and this map. |
| `story/` | Notes from earlier attempts (read-only history). |
| `tools/` | Developer scripts. |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | All targets and their explicit source lists; pins `ICD_WX_VERSION`. |
| `cmake/IcdCompilerOptions.cmake` | `icd_target_defaults()`: C++23, `/W4 /WX /permissive-`, Unicode and Windows defines. |
| `cmake/IcdWxWidgets.cmake` | Imported targets `wx::base`, `wx::core`, `wx::wx` from `3rdparty/wxWidgets`; checks the fetch stamp. |
| `build.bat` | `build.bat [Debug|Release|All]`: fetches wx, configures `build/` (VS 2026, x64) once, builds. |
| `.gitattributes` | CRLF for `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.ps1`. |
| `quality.bat` | `quality.bat [changed|all]`: creates `.venv-quality`, enters vcvars64, configures `build/quality` (Ninja + cl, compile database, no PCH), builds `check-quality[-all]`. |
| `.clang-tidy` | clang-tidy checks and the cognitive complexity threshold (10). |
| `cmake/QualityCommon.cmake` | Scope, paths and the changed-file helper shared by the check scripts. |
| `cmake/CheckComplexity.cmake` | Lizard gate (CCN <= 10) over `src/`. |
| `cmake/CheckClangTidy.cmake` | clang-tidy gate: selects `src/` entries from the compile database, runs `run-clang-tidy`. |
| `cmake/quality_scope.py` | Changed-file selection: changed files, plus `.cpp` files that include a changed header. |
| `tools/requirements-quality.txt` | Pinned clang-tidy 22.1.8 and Lizard 1.24.0 for `.venv-quality`. |

## Targets

| Target | Kind | Sources | Links |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `icd_core` | static lib | `src/core/**` | - |
| `icd_platform` | static lib | `src/platform/win/**` | `icd_core` |
| `icd_services` | static lib | `src/services/**` | `icd_core`, `icd_platform` |
| `IroncladDefrag` | GUI exe | `src/main.cpp`, `src/ui/**`, PCH `src/precompiled.h` | `icd_services`, `wx::wx` |
| `icd-cli` | console exe | `src/cli/**` | `icd_services` |
| `check-complexity[-all]`, `check-clang-tidy[-all]`, `check-quality[-all]` | custom | quality gate; clang-tidy only in Ninja builds with a compile database | - |

## Source files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/core/format/ByteSize.*` | `formatBytes()`: Explorer-style byte sizes. |
| `src/platform/win/WinError.*` | `formatWinError()`, `lastWinError()`: Win32 error text. |
| `src/services/AppInfo.*` | Product name and version (from `ICD_VERSION_STRING`) for GUI and CLI. |
| `src/precompiled.h` | GUI PCH: `<wx/wx.h>` and std headers only. |
| `src/main.cpp` | `wxIMPLEMENT_APP(icd::App)`. |
| `src/ui/App.*` | `icd::App`: creates the main frame. |
| `src/ui/MainFrame.*` | Empty main window. |
| `src/cli/main.cpp` | `icd-cli`: `--version`, `--help`. |

## Tools

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/fetch-wx.ps1` | Downloads the pinned wxWidgets prebuilt MSVC x64 archives (Dev, ReleaseDLL, headers), checks SHA-256, extracts to `3rdparty/wxWidgets`. No-op when the stamp matches; `-Force` redoes it. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | How it is obtained |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wxWidgets (MSW, vc14x x64 DLL) | 3.3.4 | `tools/fetch-wx.ps1`; version and hashes pinned in the script. |

## Generated output (git-ignored)

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `build/` | VS solution; `build/bin/<Config>/` holds both exes and the wx DLLs of that config. |
| `build/quality/` | Ninja + cl configure for the quality gate; `quality/` holds scope lists and the selected database. |
| `.venv-quality/` | Python venv with the pinned analyzers. |
| `3rdparty/downloads/` | Cached wx archives. |
| `3rdparty/wxWidgets/` | `include/`, `include/msvc/`, `lib/vc14x_x64_dll/` (import libs, debug and release DLLs), `icd-wx-stamp.txt`. |
