# Architecture Notes

How the code is layered and where responsibilities live. The full design is in `plan.md` (section 5);
this file records what is actually built and the decisions made along the way.

## Layers (target, from `plan.md` section 5)

- `src/core` - wx-free, Win32-free C++20 model and algorithms.
- `src/platform/win` - narrow Win32 wrappers.
- `src/services` - jobs, thread pool, orchestration.
- `src/ui` - wxWidgets windows and widgets.
- `src/cli` - `icd-cli` console front end.

## Third-party

- wxWidgets is used as prebuilt DLLs only (no source build). `tools/fetch-wx.ps1` is the only way the
  tree under `3rdparty/wxWidgets` is produced, so every machine builds against the same pinned files.
